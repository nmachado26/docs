<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Creating a transform job:

<CodeGroup>

```python python
def create_job(data:list, end_Install Mintlify on your OSmodel:dict, pipeline:str):
    url = f'{base_url}/v1/create_transformation'
    headers = {'lume_api_key': cardinal_api_key}
    payload = {
        "data": data,
        "end_model": end_model,
        "pipeline": pipeline
    }
    job = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload).json()
    return job
```

```javascript javascript
async function createJob(data, endModel, pipeline) {
    const url = `${baseUrl}/v1/create_transformation`;
    const headers = { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'lume_api_key': apiKey };
    const payload = {
        data: data,
        end_model: JSON.stringify(endModel),
        pipeline: pipeline
    };
    const response = await fetch(url, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: headers,
        body: JSON.stringify(payload)
    });
    const job = await response.json();
    return job;
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Startup
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing)
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deploy successfully went through:

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the CLI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to Node v18. Run `mintlify install` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No such file or directory on Windows">
Go to the `C:/Users/Username/.mintlify/` directory and remove the `mint`
folder. Then Open the Git Bash in this location and run `git clone
https://github.com/mintlify/mint.git`.

Repeat step 3.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Getting an unknown error">
    Try navigating to the root of your device and delete the ~/.mintlify folder.
    Then run `mintlify dev` again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
